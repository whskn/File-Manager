# File-Manager
Console File Manager based on WINAPI

# Functions 
You can:
* Delete file
* Rename file
* move file
* copy/past file
* create directories

# Files
* `Main.cpp` the main one
* `File.cpp` file management functions 
* `Cursor.cpp` cursor move function
* `Header.h` initializes all functions & includes all libraries

P.S. this is one of my first cpp projects, which was created long before I started using github. So please don't be too strict.
